# Unit Conversion Exercise
For this project you are to create a program that will perform unit conversions for;

- temperature (degrees Celsius vs. degrees Fahrenheit)
- distance (centimeters vs. inches)
- weight (kilograms vs. pounds)
- volume (liters vs. quarts)

The user should be able to select the conversion to perform and enter the appropriate value to be converted. The program should be menu driven and contain if-elseif structure or switch structure to select the various options. The program should also include simple ifs to check the validity of the entered data, e.g. the user should not be able to enter a negative number for dimensions or temperatures below absolute. (You should assume that the user will not input an invalid value more than once.)

Output should contain the original data and units plus the newly converted data and units. Output could look something like the following:

- Degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Inches to Centimeters
- Centimeters to Inches
- Pounds to Kilograms
- Kilograms to Pounds
- Quarts to Liters
- Liters to Quarts
