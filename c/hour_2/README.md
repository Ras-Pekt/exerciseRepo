# HOUR_2
This directory contains solutions to the coding questions of **Hour 2, Writing Your First C Program**, of **Sam's Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours**. The questions are as follows:

- [Exer_2](hr2ex2.c) - write a C program that can print out a message: 
	`It’s fun to write my own program in C.`
- [Exer_3](hr2ex3.c) - Update the program in Listing 2.1 by adding one more newline character into the message printed out by the printf() function. You should see two lines of the message on the screen after running the updated executable file:
	`Howdy, neighbor!
	This is my first C program.`
- [Exer_4](hr2ex4.c) - What warning or error messages, if any, will you get when you’re compiling the following program?
	```
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	main()
	{
		printf (“Howdy, neighbor! This is my first C program.\n”);
		exit(0);
	}
	```
- [Exer_5](hr2ex5.c) - What error messages will you get for the following program when you’re trying to
compile it?
	void main()
	```
	{
		printf (“Howdy, neighbor! This is my first C program.\n”);
		return 0;
	}
	```
	
** DISCLAIMER: Some of the code is intentionally wrong, to find out common coding mistakes, learn to interpret error messages and practice debugging code from such error messages **
