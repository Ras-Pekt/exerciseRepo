# HOUR_3
This directory contains solutions to the coding questions of **Hour 3, Learning the Structure of a C Program**, of **Sam's Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours**. The questions are as follows:

- [Exer_2](hr3ex2.c) - What is wrong with the following function?
	```
	int 3integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
	{
		int sum;
		sum = x + y + z;
		return sum;
	}
	```
- [Exer_3](hr3ex3.c) - What is wrong with the following function?
	```
	int integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
	{
		int sum;
		sum = x + y + z
		return sum;
	}
	```
- [Exer_4](hr3ex4.c) - Write a C function that can perform a multiplication of two integers and return the calculated result.
- [Exer_5](hr3ex5.c) - Write a C program that calls the C function you just wrote in the above exercise to calculate the multiplication of 3 times 5 and then print out the return value from the function on the screen.

**DISCLAIMER: Some of the code is intentionally wrong, to find out common coding mistakes, learn to interpret error messages and practice debugging code from such error messages**
